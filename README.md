## Notice

  [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/ninja7-bot/ZeroTwoRepo)

### NOTE
1. Get yourself a database from [Elephant SQL](elephantsql.com) instead of using Heroku Add on.
2. Add Redis Cloud as well. Create new VAR REDIS_URL and fill it with the URL you got from the add on. Also, it is free ^_^ 
3. Don't bother anyone else for your own sake, no one asked you to be a dev, it was your own choice. Learn by yourself as well.
